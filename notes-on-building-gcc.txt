GCC configure option bootstrap is auto disabled when cross compiling.
Therfore, cross GCC compile directions assume disable-bootstrap is used.
So, set that option when trying to borrow steps from those directions.

Building an non cross GCC under msys2 mingw with configure option 
"--disable-bootstrap" requires an edit of gcc/Makefile.in.

The "CPPFLAGS" seems to be ignored when building GCC
